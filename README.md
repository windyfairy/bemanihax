# bemanihax

The project build system and some of the utils are copied from bemanitools.

This project is automatically built by CircleCI. The latest build can always be found under the [releases](https://github.com/windyfairy/bemanihax/releases) tab on Github.

### Build Instructions

Instructions tested with Windows Subsystem for Linux as well as Ubuntu. You may be able to get it working with cygwin and friends using the same instructions but I can't guarantee anything.

1.) Install required tools
```
~> sudo apt-get install g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 g++-mingw-w64-i686 zip make
```

2.) Build
```
~> make
```
